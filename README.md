# Crosswords

Generating crosswords with interesting topology from clues using python networkx

## The idea

Traditional crosswords are designed partially by hand, so it is hard to quickly generate custom crosswords on topics you are interested in, e.g. a foreign language
or geography. 

This is an attempt to solve this problem by generating a new type of crossword. Designing a crossword based on fixed answers is a difficult problem, and probably
for most lists of words the only crosswords you can create will be very sparse. This is due to the rigidity of the format. We instead allow a much more flexible
layout. The crossword will consist of a directed graph with numbered nodes in which some of the paths have been colored. Each answer will be written along one 
colored path. The corresponding clue will tell you which colored path to look at it by indicating the start and the color of the path. The paths should be colored
in such a way that there is no ambiguity.

## A first attempt

The first attempt is with a directed grid graph. The following crossword is for a 7x7 grid; for now the clues are just the answers.

The crossword is generated by putting the words in random order and greedily putting each word in so as to cross other words as many times as possible. 
As you can see, things end up a bit sparse. There are a few fixes forthcoming. One is to try a graph with higher degree, for instance diagonals could be allowed
in the grid. Another is to encourage less "packing" of early solutions so that certain regions don't become blocked off by inaccessible letters. Finally, one could
sort the words so that similar words are inserted at similar times.
